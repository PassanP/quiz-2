quiz for term 1
Hi Airrick,

I learned coding which i never imaged before.however,i think (my thinking as I'm learning coding first time) that more coding practice session need to be in this course except the weekly class.

Certainly, I'll bother you in future with my wired questions,till I become a sensible coder .
Thanks for your support in advance.
